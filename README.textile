Genetic Algorithm Library In Actionscript

h2. Project Goals

The primary intent is to create a powerful genetic algorithm library that is easy to use for various problem spaces.

The secondary intent is to make it easy to visualize the execution of genetic algorithms.

This library is currently in *pre-release development*, so beware shifting dunes of code and API-drift.
